**Which of your alerts are worth their page?** `lapilli verdict` judges every
firing against what actually went wrong: a white stone when the alert caught an
incident, a black stone when nothing was wrong. Count a rule's stones over a
week and you know whether it earns its place; an incident with no stone is one
your alerts missed.

## Why

Alert rules pile up. One is added after each incident, few are taken away, and
nobody can say which ones still earn their page. The way teams find out is by
hand: read a week of alert channels next to the incident notes, mark each alert
as useful or noise, and look for incidents that nothing caught. It is slow, so
it rarely happens, and a rule that has paged for nothing a hundred times keeps
paging.

Lapilli does that reading. It works from what you already have: the rules, the
history in Prometheus, and whatever record of incidents you keep, even a thin
one.

## The name

> *mos erat antiquus niveis atrisque lapillis,*
> *his damnare reos, illis absolvere culpa*
>
> It was the old custom to judge with white and black pebbles: the black to
> condemn the accused, the white to acquit them.
>
> — Ovid, *Metamorphoses* XV.41–42

*Lapilli* are small stones. Each firing is a vote; the urn is emptied once a
week and the stones are counted.

## How it judges

**Firings** come from one of three places:

- `--rules FILE`: replay alert rules against history, so it works on rules you
  just wrote and on history from before you had Lapilli. It reads Prometheus
  rule files, `PrometheusRule` resources, Grafana alerting provisioning files,
  and ConfigMaps holding any of them. Grafana rules are evaluated the way
  Grafana evaluates them: each query fetched as PromQL, then reduce, threshold
  and math, where a comparison gives 1 or 0 and two sets of series pair up by
  their labels. `for` is honoured.
- `--alerts`: the `ALERTS` series Prometheus keeps for its own rules.
- `--firings FILE`: firings recorded elsewhere, one JSON object a line
  (`{"rule":"...","labels":{...},"start":"...","end":"..."}`).

**Incidents** come from a file, from a signal of user impact, or both:

```yaml
incidents:
  - id: INC-41
    title: Checkout errors
    start: 2026-10-28T12:01:00+09:00
    end: 2026-10-28T12:40:00+09:00   # optional; an hour when missing
    labels: {service: checkout}      # optional, for --match
```

`--impact PROMQL` turns every window where the expression returns something,
for at least `--impact-for` (5m), into an incident too. An error-rate SLI works
well: the incidents nobody wrote down are often the ones no alert caught.

**A firing catches an incident** when it starts between `--lead` (15m) before
the incident and its end, and agrees with it on any `--match` labels both
carry. An alert that was already firing before that caught nothing: it was on
anyway. A firing that comes within `--refire` (1h) of the same alert resolving
is counted as refired.

**Noisy rules.** A rule that fired 10 times or more in the period, with under
20% of its firings catching anything, fires whatever happens; when it lands on
an incident that is likely chance. Its catches are shown marked `(noisy)`, not
dropped, since a noisy rule can also fire for the right reason. An incident
caught only by noisy rules is reported as such, and its detection delay is
taken from the first rule that isn't noisy.

## Use

```sh
# a week of your Grafana rules, against Google Managed Prometheus
lapilli verdict --rules alert-rules.yaml --gcp-project my-project --incidents incidents.yaml

# what Prometheus actually fired last month
lapilli verdict --alerts --prometheus http://prometheus:9090 --since 30d --incidents incidents.yaml

# a rule you are about to merge: would it have caught last quarter's incidents, and how often would it have paged?
lapilli verdict --rules new-rule.yaml --prometheus http://prometheus:9090 --since 90d --incidents incidents.yaml

# weekly, into node_exporter's textfile collector
lapilli verdict --rules alert-rules.yaml --prometheus http://prometheus:9090 --incidents incidents.yaml \
  --metrics > lapilli.prom.tmp && mv lapilli.prom.tmp lapilli.prom
```

`--json` gives the whole report, every firing and its stone included.
`--metrics` gives `lapilli_rule_firings`, `lapilli_rule_caught`,
`lapilli_rule_nothing`, `lapilli_rule_refired` (by `rule`),
`lapilli_incidents` (by `state` and `source`) and
`lapilli_incident_detection_delay_seconds`.

`--prometheus URL` takes any Prometheus-compatible API: Prometheus, Thanos,
Mimir, VictoriaMetrics. `--bearer-token-file` adds a token;
`--gcp-project` uses Google Managed Service for Prometheus with Application
Default Credentials. Lapilli only reads.

## What it doesn't do yet

- Grafana `classic_conditions` and queries to datasources that don't speak
  PromQL (Loki, SQL) can't be replayed; such rules are listed with the reason.
- No-data and error states are not replayed, only the condition.
- Replays evaluate every `--step` (1m), which may differ from a rule's own
  evaluation interval.
- Rule names are the key: two rules with the same name in different groups
  are counted together.
